Upgrading
"""""""""

If you are upgrading from an older version than v2.0.0, please make sure to read the `v.2.0.0 upgrade notes <https://github.com/Bisudoh/Gokapi/releases/tag/v2.0.0>`__ first.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Bisudoh/Gokapi/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1


v2.0.0 (2025-05-31)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::
     Make sure that you have a backup of all data. It is not possible to downgrade afterwards. 

This release adds user management and granular permission control. Some breaking changes are introduced, please make sure to read the section *Upgrading*. 


Security
""""""""

This releases fixes two XSS vulnerabilities (`CVE-2025-48494 <https://github.com/Bisudoh/Gokapi/security/advisories/GHSA-95rc-wc32-gm53>`__ and `CVE-2025-48495 <https://github.com/Bisudoh/Gokapi/security/advisories/GHSA-4xg4-54hm-9j77>`__). The vulnerabilities let authorised users execute Javascript with passive interaction - if you are using Gokapi as a single user, this does not impact you, otherwise we recommend updating your instance to v2.0.0.

Changelog
"""""""""

* Fixed bug where picture files where not uploaded at all when encryption and cloud storage was active as well as ``SaveToLocal`` `#247 <https://github.com/Bisudoh/Gokapi/issues/247>`__
* Many other fixes and minor improvements @nilicule 

Upgrading
"""""""""

Upgrade path: **Requires v1.9.6 as base**, ``config.json`` must be writable

Upgrading when using OAuth2/OIDC authentication:
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

 - A valid email must now be set for all users in the authentication backend
 - Authentication is now only done by email and can be restricted by user groups
 - Set the env variable ``GOKAPI_ADMIN_USER`` containing the email address of the super admin when upgrading 

Upgrading when using Header authentication
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* If restricting the users by username, make sure that you remove any wildcards (*) for usernames in the setup before upgrading.
* Set the env variable ``GOKAPI_ADMIN_USER`` containing the email address of the super admin when upgrading

Upgrading when using no authentication
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* If you are restricting access with a proxy, make sure that you block the following urls:

  * /admin
  * /apiKeys
  * /changePassword
  * /e2eInfo
  * /e2eSetup
  * /logs
  * /uploadChunk
  * /uploadStatus
  * /users
 

Upgrading when using custom templates or static content
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The previous way of replacing content has been removed and is now replaced with additive CSS and JS. If you want to change the layout (e.g. add your company logo or add/disable certain features), follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder named custom where your executable is. When using Docker, mount a new folder to /``app/custom/``. Any file in this directory will be publicly available in the sub-URL ``/custom/``.
2. To have custom CSS included, create a file in the folder named ``custom.css``. The CSS will be applied to all pages.
3. To have custom JavaScript included, create the file ``public.js`` for all public pages and/or ``admin.js`` for all admin-related pages. Please note that the ``admin.js`` will be readable to all users.
4. In order to prevent caching issues, you can version your files by creating the file ``version.txt`` with a version number.
5. Restart the server. If the folders exist, the server will now add the local files.

Optional: If you require further changes or want to embedded the changes permanently, you can clone the source code and then modify the templates in ``internal/webserver/web/templates``. Afterwards run ``make`` to build a new binary with these changes.

Breaking Changes
""""""""""""""""

Since v1.9 there have been a lot of changes to the API, please take note if you are using the API:

* A valid API key is now always required, API authentication by session is not possible anymore
* ``/chunk/complete`` and ``/files/duplicate`` now expect the parameters as header, instead of encoded url form
* Parameter ``apiKeyToModify`` has been renamed to ``targetKey`` for ``/auth/modify``, ``/auth/delete`` and ``/auth/friendlyname``
* If a user, api key or file is not found, but a plausible ID was submitted, error 404 instead of 400 is returned now
* Before v2.0, if a boolean parameter was required, it was always false if anything else then "true" was sent, now it raises an error if any other value than 1, t, true, 0, f, or false is supplied
* Some API calls might be restricted by user permissions now, consult the API documentation for more information
* API keys now have a public ID as well, which can also be used for ``/auth/modify``, ``/auth/delete`` and ``/auth/friendlyname`` as ``targetKey`` instead of the private ID
* When uploading a file through the API, defaults of 14 days, max 1 download and no password will be used, unless the respective parameters were passed. In v1.9, the previous values were used.


ðŸ’™ **A huge thank you** to all our users, bug reporters, and contributors who made this release possible!

""""""""""""""""

A developer version between v1.1.2  and v1.1.3 introduced a bug that prevented the usage of salts for hashing passwords! If you have only been using the regular releases, this notice does not apply to you.

If you created your admin account with a developer version of v1.1.2 or changed the password in a developer version of v1.1.2, you will need to run the following command: ``./gokapi --reset-pw``. You can enter the same password again. If you skip this step, you will be unable to login.

Files that have been password-protected with a developer version of v1.1.2 need to be uploaded again.


v1.1.2 (2021-04-03)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changelog
"""""""""

* Configurations like length of the ID or salts can be changed with env variables now
